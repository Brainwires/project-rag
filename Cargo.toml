# This feature is prepared but not yet fully implemented
# When enabled, uses stack-graphs for ~95% accuracy name resolution

# Note: There is no "mcp" feature - both library and MCP server are always built together
# This is a dual-purpose crate that provides:
# - RagClient: Core library API for embedding in Rust applications
# - RagMcpServer: MCP protocol server that wraps RagClient
# - Binary: MCP server that can be run standalone
