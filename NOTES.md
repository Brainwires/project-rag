Need to verify support for multiple sub-projects in a project when indexing.
Combine update and index in to one command that does both full and incremental based on existing index.
We should ALWAYS be blocking the indexing of "**/.git/**" if we are not already!!! 
    - Or really it should have it's own form of git repo indexing / searching
Add a CLI argument "--version" and "-v" that console log the database being used.
