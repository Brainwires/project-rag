Need to verify support for multiple sub-projects in a project when indexing.
✅ DONE: Combined update and index into one smart command that auto-detects full vs incremental based on existing cache.
We should ALWAYS be blocking the indexing of "**/.git/**" if we are not already!!! 
    - Or really it should have it's own form of git repo indexing / searching
Add a CLI argument "--version" and "-v" that console log the database being used.
